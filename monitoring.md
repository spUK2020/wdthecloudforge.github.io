# Azure Monitoring and Observability Configuration

Azure provides cloud-based tools to allow you to monitor across all levels of your software stack and also the underlying compute, storage and networking components provided by Azure itself. 
The issue every business faces is understanding what services and solutions deliver end-to-end visibility to ensure quick resolution of anomolies and ensure performance and availability are maintained within SLAs. Moreover, in addition to the Technology focus for monitoring we need to establish a baseline for both People and Process.

## Get Started

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a full lifecycle framework that enables cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers to achieve their cloud adoption goals. It provides best practices, documentation, and tools that help you create and implement business and technology strategies for the cloud.

Within the Cloud Adoption Framework is existing documentation that details how you should formulate a strategy. It also covers how you begin to define a monitoring strategy.
