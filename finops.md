# Azure FinOps Configuration

Managing costs in cloud requires discipline, organizational strategy and consistency.  Each month the procurement/Finance team will get an invoice from the providers detailing resources, time used and total cost.  For a team who probably doesn't know who is using it, it's really hard to understand how the payment is going to be done.  These teams need to understand costs/spend for each cost-center using cloud services.

There is a lot of documentation already about how to organize and cost manage spend in Azure by using subscriptions, resource groups and tags here.  This information is useful but doesn't complete the cycle, there is still integrations they need to complete to make sure their finance systems will acquired the information per month.  This becomes a bigger challenge if the customer is using a multi-cloud approach.

Another challenge customers have is around optimization, and control of resources been used or not used.  Is easy to forget to delete resources we don't need to use anymore or to choose the biggest VMs or tiers because the team doesn't know how the applications will behave.  This is why monitoring and perfomance reports are needed to complete the Finops Operations.
